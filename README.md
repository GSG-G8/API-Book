## Why we build this project?
We build this project for the people who are fond of reading and watching the movies of the same books.  So if he/she searches for the title of the book, the movie of the same book will appear under it. We make this site to help the people in their search, so they don't have to spend many hours searching in different sites for the book and the movie. By one click they will reach their goal.

* The first section is the header section, which contain the logo of the app.
