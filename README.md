## Why we build this project?
We build this project for the people who are fond of reading and watching the movies of the same books.  So if he/she searches for the title of the book, the movie of the same book will appear under it. We make this site to help the people in their search, so they don't have to spend many hours searching in different sites for the book and the movie. By one click they will reach their goal.

 ## What is our project contain?
Our project contain three section:

* The first section is the header section, which contain the logo of the app.

* The second section is the main page, which contain the books and the movies.

* The third section is the footer, which contain the copyright.


## How the process of building our project done?

* We start by sketching our site, and deciding how the design will be .

* Then we divied our tasks, and every pair start with the reqiuered tasks.

* After that we collected all of our work together, and we see the final result.

* Finally we test our site if it responsive and accessible.

## Requirements:

* Your app queries at least two APIs using the XMLHttpRequest method

* Your app features some dynamic content
* A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme.

* A well-considered architecture for your app - think back to the workshops from the beginning of this week.

* Try to modularise your code, or break it down into separate files. Document any key decisions about how you structure your code in your readme!

* Code: break your JavaScript down into small functions with a clear input and output; this will make it easy to write tests

* Tests: write tests for your pure functions. We don't expect tests on the DOM or on the response from an API.

* Design: aim for a responsive, mobile-first design

* Accessibility: same as always, we'll be running your code through accessibility checkers

* Take appropriate measures when it comes to concealing private information (i.e. your API key!)
